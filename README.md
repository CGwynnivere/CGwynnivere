- 👋 Hi, I’m @CGwynnivere and I do not know how to code at all.
- 👀 I’m interested in trying out github as a way to keep track of progress on a writing project I have.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how the hell this thing works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular at the moment. I use github in a weird way i'm not sure how many ppl here would vibe with this project.
- 📫 How to reach me? Still tbd, in the meantime I will be accessible via carrier pigeon.
